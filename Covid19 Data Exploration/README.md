## Summary of the project
This data exploration project aims to help me practice more techniques of exploring data using SQL, and to explore various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic using available datasets. The analysis includes examining trends, patterns, and insights related to infection rates, mortality rates, vaccination progress, and other relevant factors across different regions and time periods.

## Source of dataset
[Our World Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

## Objectives
- Analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 globally and regionally.
- Identify trends and patterns in infection rates, mortality rates, and vaccination progress.
- Investigate factors influencing variations in COVID-19 outcomes across different regions.
- Extract insights to inform public health policies and interventions.
- And practicing using SQL for Data Exploration
  
## Questions
- Looking at totalDeaths, totalCases and totalVaccinations per location -Globally
- Looking at Total Deaths Vs Total Cases
- Looking at the Total Cases vs the Population (Mozambique). This shows the percentage of the population who got covid
- Looking at the Total Deaths vs the Population (Mozambique). This shows the percentage of the population who died
- Looking at countries with high infection rate compared to population
- Looking at countries with high Death count compared to population. (Mozambique and more)
- Total deaths per Continent
- Looking at Total population vs Vaccinations - Rolling Count of Vaccinations daily
- Using CTE to calculate the ratio of population that are vaccinated daily --- Looking at Total population vs Vaccinations - Rolling Count of Vaccinations daily 
- Using Temp table to calculate the ratio of population that are Tested daily- -- Looking at Total population vs New people tested - Rolling Count of new people tested daily 


## Installations
- SQL Server Management Studio 19
