## Summary of the project
The Housing Data Cleaning project aims to preprocess and clean a dataset containing information about properties. The dataset requires standardization of date formats, splitting address details into individual columns, parsing 'OwnerAddress' into address components, updating values, removing duplicates, unused columns, and joining tables for comprehensive analysis.

## Source of dataset
[Dataset from AlexTheAnalyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst)

## Objectives/Questions
- Standardize date formats to ensure consistency and ease of analysis.
- Break down address details into separate columns (Address, City, State) for improved readability and analysis.
- Parse 'OwnerAddress' to extract address components (Address, City, State) using appropriate techniques.
- Update values such as 'Y' and 'N' to 'Yes' and 'No' in the "Sold as Vacant" field for clarity.
- Remove duplicates and unused columns to streamline the dataset.
- Update and modify columns as needed to enhance data quality and usability.
- Join two different tables together to enrich the dataset and facilitate comprehensive analysis. 


## Installations
